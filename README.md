# Why fedora-contributor-trends?
This is a hacky collection of scripts to create visualizations and hopefully insight from contributor-triggered activity on Fedora's messaging bus,via the "datagrepper" service. Results are currently run on a personal system belonging to Matthew Miller, and published weekly there: https://mattdm.org/fedora/fedora-contributor-trends/
There's also a text report: https://mattdm.org/fedora/fedora-contributor-trends/report.txt.
